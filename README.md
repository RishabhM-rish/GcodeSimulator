# GcodeSimulator
This is a Blender Add-on for 3D concrete printers to import the Gcode file and cross examining the bounds of workspace.

Currently supports only G0 and G1 commands only.

Features:
Required volume can be calculated.
Exact positioning relative to origin can be analysed. 
3D printing workspace can be updated as per your machine and it can be ensured that the printing lie within the bounds.
Great user interface.
